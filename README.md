## About

Progress Element is a custom element for YOOtheme Pro developed by [YOOtheme](https://yootheme.com).

## Hints

The progress bar color can be set in the Page Builder at _STYLE > Progress > BAR > Background_.

While developing custom elements it might appear to you that changes to the code do not come into effect. If that is the case, try to force a browser refresh while within the Page Builder using \[Ctrl+F5\] (Windows) or \[Cmd+R\] (macOS).
